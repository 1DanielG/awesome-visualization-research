A curated list of awesome data visualizations research papers, books, blog posts, and other readings. If you are looking for more practical tools and libraries see [awesome-dataviz](https://github.com/fasouto/awesome-dataviz). At present this is very biased towards things I am reading for my personal research interests, but I'd gladly accept pull requests.
