# Awesome visualization research

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome data visualizations research papers, books, blog posts, and other readings. If you are looking for more practical tools and libraries see [awesome-dataviz](https://github.com/fasouto/awesome-dataviz). At present this is very biased towards things I am reading for my personal research interests, but I'd gladly accept pull requests.

## Animation

- [Animation: From Cartoons to the User Interface](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2009/cs4470_fall/readings/animation.pdf) - lessons that interface designers can learn from cartoonists

## Big Data

- [imMens: Real-time visual querying of big data](http://vis.stanford.edu/projects/immens/) - in browser system that leverages the GPU for real-time interaction
- [Nanocubes: Fast visualization of large spatiotemporal datasets](http://nanocubes.net/) - specialized database system for visualizing spatiotemporal datasets

## Color

- [mpl colormaps: a better default colormap for matplotlib](https://bids.github.io/colormap/) - detailed account of designing a better colormap for the popular matplotlib library
- [How we designed the new color palettes in Tableau 10](https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2016/7/colors-upgrade-tableau-10-56782) - overview of designing color palettes in tableau

## Data Management

- [The Case for Data Visualization Management Systems](http://db.csail.mit.edu/pubs/p903-wu.pdf) - a vision paper arguing why we should build wholistic systems thinking of visualization and user interaction from the very start
- [Data Cube: A Relational Aggregation Operator Generalizing Group-By, Cross-Tab, and Sub-Totals](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/chrismre/cs345/rl/olap.pdf) - paper introducing the classic data cube

## Human Computer Interaction

- [The Effects of Interactive Latency on Exploratory Visual Analysis](https://idl.cs.washington.edu/files/2014-Latency-InfoVis.pdf) - a look at how latency in a user interface can affect user behavior and impact what they learn about datasets

## Research Methods

- [Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information Visualization Research Papers](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2008/pitfalls/pitfalls.pdf) - an overview of different types of information visualization papers, and common problems that researchers face

## Systems, Toolkits, and Libraries

- [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) - an open source visualization grammer, enables other applications to build powerful abstractions on top of it
- [Vega Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) - a high level visualization grammer, built on top of vega
